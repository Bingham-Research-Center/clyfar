## Post-processing
The output of Clyfar will be part of a wider, modular approach. We develop some small post-processing functions herein, such as error correction for known errors, etc. 

### Future
* Add background fluctuation - maybe function of variability / fractalness of historical time series
* A new package that post-processes Clyfar output and we decide it's outside the scope of the Clyfar project
