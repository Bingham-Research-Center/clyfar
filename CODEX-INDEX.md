# Codex Context Index
Date updated: 2025-09-25

Use this index to orient future Codex sessions quickly. Each entry lists the key doc and what it covers.

- `AGENTS.md` — Repository guidelines, project structure, coding conventions, testing notes.
- `CODEX-REFACTOR-PLAN.md` — Current refactor roadmap, milestone microtasks, execution plan, and targeted recommendations.
- `ML-IDEAS.md` — Machine-learning exploration notes, plain-language summary, optimisation ideas for FIS evolution.
- `README.md` — High-level project introduction and setup prerequisites.
- `CODEX-INDEX.md` — Start here; updated whenever major guidance docs change.
- `notebooks/reference/` — Expanded narrative notebooks (e.g., `clyfar_explained.ipynb`).
- `scripts/` (planned) — Placeholder for automation; see roadmap for pending additions.

Maintenance actions:
- Update this index whenever new context docs are added or renamed.
- Keep `Date updated` in each doc current when changes land.
- Remove stale entries if files are deleted or archived.
