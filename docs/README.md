# Documentation Hub
Date updated: 2025-10-09

Use this page as the jumping-off point for orientation, planning, and deeper research. Follow the "Quick start" list first, then dive into the topical docs as needed.

## Quick start
- [`README.md`](../README.md#environment-setup) — Project summary, prerequisites, and the canonical smoke test (mirrored in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#testing-guidelines)).
- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#testing-guidelines) — Collaboration guardrails, coding conventions, day-to-day workflows, and the same smoke command under Testing Guidelines (points back to the README entry above for consistency).
- `docs/AI_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` — **AI agents start here:** efficient protocol to minimize token usage and respect team conventions.
- `docs/project_overview.md` — Narrative tour of the architecture and possibility-theory framing.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Current refactor milestones, microtasks, and execution plan.

## Topical references
- `docs/setup_conda.md` — Step-by-step Miniforge/Conda environment setup.
- `docs/experiments/multi_version_winter.md` — Multi-version winter experiment playbook.
- `docs/ml_ideas.md` — Machine-learning and optimisation concepts for evolving the FIS.
- `docs/patches_table.md` — Table of tactical fixes with notes on future relevance.
- `docs/cross_repo_workflow.md` — Guidance for coordinating with adjacent knowledge-base repositories.
- `docs/repo_review.md` — Snapshot of code structure, risks, and improvement opportunities.
- `docs/validation.md` — Local smoke test command and SLURM submission template.
- `docs/TESTING.md` — Pytest primer and conventions.
- `docs/science-questions.md` — Concise, high‑impact questions driving MF calibration and science changes.

## Optional deep dives
- `notebooks/README.md` — Notebook index with purpose and maturity signals.
- `notebooks/reference/clyfar_explained.ipynb` — Narrative walkthrough for stakeholders.
- `filetree.txt` — Auto-generated view of the current repository layout.

## Maintenance checklist
- Update this hub whenever docs are added, renamed, or relocated.
- Refresh the "Date updated" stamp and key links after significant content edits.
- Archive or delete pointers to documents that move out of the repository.
